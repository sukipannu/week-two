# week-two

This is the start of my first professional coding portfolio. 

I added a header, footer, and body section. The body includes three sub-sections: About Me, My Work, and Contact. 

In the My Work section, I have added my first Run Buddy project. 

The site should also size down depending on the type of device you are using.
